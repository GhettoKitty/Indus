## Brief Intro to Indus
Indus is a Metasploit-like tool where you can run many advanced and cool commands. Some of these features involved scanning IPs, brute-forcing passwords, etc.
Indus as of right now is a free program. If you want to donate, please try and DM me. My contact info is below.

## Terms of Service

I'm not gonna make this complex and legal, I'm gonna try and make it easy to read:
> Don't use it to hack your friends without permission
> Don't go around scanning the grandma next door's WiFi and hacking into the WiFi
> Don't distribute the License Key unless given permission to by the owner of this repository (vizium0)

(More Sneak Peeks coming out in the future!)

## Prerequisites

You must have a Windows Operating System (Windows 8, 10, and 11 work.)
Running as admin is not strictly neccessary, although some features may not be available.

## Installation

First, under releases, click **Indus v1.1.3**. Click on Indus.zip to download the zip file, and wait until it is downloaded.

Once it is downloaded as a zip, extract it by clicking Extract All.

Now, once you have downloaded it, click on the extracted folder and navigate to C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads\Indus\Indus. You should find 2 files, one called settings.json, the other called Indus.exe.
Indus.exe is the tool, however, you must do some things in settings.json.

You are going to change "ACCEPT_TOS": false, to "ACCEPT_TOS": true. When doing it, you accept to Indus's and GitHub's TOS (Terms of Service).

I am developing Indus to be compatible with Linux and Ubuntu, so stay tuned!
