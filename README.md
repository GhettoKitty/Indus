## Brief Intro to Indus
Indus is a Metasploit-like tool where you can run many advanced and cool commands. Some of these features involved scanning IPs, brute-forcing passwords, etc.
Indus as of right now is a free program. If you want to donate, please try and DM me. My contact info is below.

## Forewarning
